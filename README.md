# Overview
The Smart Doorway Reminder System is a sophisticated device designed to help individuals remember essential items like keys and umbrellas upon exiting their homes. Utilizing Arduino Uno, it employs a PIR sensor for motion detection and a DHT-22 sensor for humidity monitoring. When intent to exit is detected, it triggers visual and auditory reminders. Despite its efficacy, enhancements such as directional sensors could improve its accuracy.
# Background & Inspiration
The inspiration for the Smart Doorway Reminder System stems from a common issue faced by many:  
forgetting essential items such as keys or umbrellas when rushing out the door. This frequent oversight can disrupt daily routines and cause significant inconvenience, particularly in rainy days.

# How it works
### Feature 1 : Key Reminder  
<img src="images/fun1.GIF" alt="" width="400">  
Green LED stays ON default  
<br>PIR sensor detects motion for 5 seconds --> determines intent to exit  
<br>Red LED blinks twice  
<br>servo motor rotates tray to catch attention  

### Feature 2 : Rainy Day Reminder  
<img src="images/fun2.jpg" alt="" width="400"> <img src="images/fun2_serial.png" alt="" width="400">  
when detecting exit intent, the DHT-22 sensor checks humidity  
if humidity > present threshold (e.g., 55%), the buzzer sounds a short alerts
